/* A media query consists of at media (@media), followed by a media type, such as screen, and then a feature on which the media query should be activated on, such as minimun width. */

    margin-right: 10px;

/* There are other media types so we can use as well. We're covered the most common ones such as screen and print. But there's also speech, which is designed for speech synthesizers as well as screen readers, and then all, which is suitable for all devices. */

/* Additionally, there are different media features. In addition to width features, there's also features for height, device orientation, resolution, and whether there's Js enabled on the page. If you revise the MDN you will find different types of media features. */

/* Lastly, we can use logical operators to chain media features together. For example 'and' that tell the query the CSS rules should be applied and a min-width (in the example above).
You can also add more 'ands' as well as 'ors'*/

/* What pixel measurements should I use for different devices?
There's no a specific rule, but regular  guidelines that CSS frameworks tend to adhere to.
Common CSS Breakpoints used by the CSS framework Bootstrap:
- Extra-small devices: less than 576px (max-width)
- Small devices: min-width: 576px (mobile phones)
- Medium devices: min-width: 768px (tablets)
- Large devices: min-width: 992px  (desktops)
- Extra-large devices: min-width: 1200px (larger desktops).

/* DevTools, in Chrome, can help us test and debug issues with media queries, note most of the browsers included devtools.
When DevTools are open, the page can be resize, and change the orientation.
This tool is essential to test media queries for all kind of devices.*/
